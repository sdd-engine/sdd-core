# External Specs

> How to import external specification documents into SDD workflows.

## Overview

External specs are product specifications - they describe WHAT to build and WHY. SDD transforms them into tech specs that describe HOW to build it.

```
External Product Spec (archived, read-only)
         │
         ▼
    Transform + Classify
         │
         ▼
    Component Discovery
         │
         ▼
    Decompose into items
         │
         ▼
    For each item:
         │
         ├─→ Solicitation (deep-dive questions)
         │
         └─→ Generate Tech Spec (SPEC.md)
```

## Importing an External Spec

```
/sdd I want to import an external spec
```

SDD will ask for the path to your spec file or directory.

For directories, SDD looks for an entry point (README.md, SPEC.md, or index.md).

## The Transformation Process

### 1. Archive

The external spec is archived via the system CLI to `sdd/archive/external-specs/` with a datetime prefix:

```
sdd/archive/external-specs/20260205-1430-feature-requirements.md
```

This is the **only** copy. The archived spec is read-only and serves as an audit trail.

### 2. Transform and Classify

SDD analyzes the external spec and classifies information:

| Category | What's Extracted |
|----------|------------------|
| **Domain Knowledge** | Entities, glossary terms, relationships |
| **Constraints** | Technical, business, compliance requirements |
| **Requirements** | Functional, non-functional, acceptance criteria |
| **Design Details** | UI specs, user flows, visual requirements |

### 3. Gap Analysis

External specs are inherently incomplete. SDD identifies gaps:

| Area | Typical Detail Level | Action |
|------|---------------------|--------|
| Frontend/UI | High | Extract and classify |
| UX/Design | High | Extract and classify |
| API/Contracts | Low | Derive from UI |
| Backend Logic | Very Low | Ask questions |
| Database/Models | Very Low | Discover from UI |
| Non-Functional | Absent | Ask explicitly |

### 4. Clarification Questions

SDD asks non-blocking, conversational questions about gaps:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

I analyzed the external spec and found:

EXTRACTED (from spec):
  - 5 screens with mockups
  - 3 user flows
  - 12 UI components

DERIVED (from UI descriptions):
  - 4 entities: User, Order, Product, Cart
  - 8 API endpoints (see below)
  - Authorization: users see only their own data

GAPS IDENTIFIED:
  - Password requirements not specified
  - Session timeout not defined
  - Error message format unclear

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I have some questions about the gaps. Take your time to read the
above, then let me know when you're ready to continue.
```

Questions are asked one at a time, with freeform responses supported.

### 5. Component Discovery

Based on the classified requirements, SDD asks targeted questions to identify which component types (defined by the active tech pack) are needed. For example, questions about data persistence, user interfaces, and external API consumers help determine the required component set.

Component discovery runs **once** for the entire external spec, not per-item.

### 6. Decomposition

Large specs are decomposed into epics and features:

```
EPICS (from H1 sections):
  01 User Management (lines 10-150)
     ├── 01 Registration (a1b2-1)
     ├── 02 Authentication (a1b2-2)
     └── 03 Password Reset (a1b2-3)

  02 Dashboard (lines 151-300) [depends on: User Management]
     ├── 01 Analytics (a1b2-4)
     └── 02 Settings (a1b2-5)

Total: 2 epics, 5 features
Implementation order: 01 → 02 (API-first within each epic)
```

You can accept the breakdown, combine into a single change, or cancel.

## Q&A Preservation

All questions and answers are preserved in the SPEC.md file's **Requirements Discovery** section:

```markdown
## Requirements Discovery

> Complete Q&A trail from spec solicitation. Never delete entries.

### Transformation Phase

| # | Question | Answer | Source |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| T1 | What should happen on duplicate email? | Return error | User |
| T2 | Session timeout duration? | 30 minutes | User |
| T3 | Password requirements? | 8+ chars default | Assumption |

### Component Discovery Phase

| # | Question | Answer | Source |
|---|----------|--------|--------|
| D1 | Does data need persistence? | Yes | User |
| D2 | External API consumers? | Mobile app | User |

### Open Questions (BLOCKING)

| # | Question | Status | Blocker For |
|---|----------|--------|-------------|
| O1 | Rate limit for login attempts? | OPEN | Security |
```

## Open Questions

Specs cannot be approved while open questions remain:

```
/sdd I want to answer an open question
```

SDD will ask which question you want to answer and whether you want to provide an answer or mark it as an assumption.

Question statuses:
- **OPEN** - Not yet answered, blocks approval
- **ANSWERED** - User provided answer
- **ASSUMED** - User said "I don't know", assumption documented
- **DEFERRED** - Moved to later phase (requires justification)

## Large Spec Handling

Specs over ~15K tokens are processed in chunks:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 LARGE SPEC DETECTED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This spec is approximately 28,000 tokens (~112 pages).
I'll process it in sections to ensure thorough analysis.

Found 5 major sections:
  1. User Management (8,200 tokens)
  2. Dashboard (6,100 tokens)
  3. Billing (5,800 tokens)
  4. Reporting (4,500 tokens)
  5. Admin Panel (3,400 tokens)

Processing section 1 of 5: User Management...

[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 1/5 sections
```

### Chunking Strategy

| Section Size | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| < 5K tokens | Process as single chunk |
| 5K - 15K tokens | Process alone |
| > 15K tokens | Split at H2/H3 boundaries |

Cross-section dependencies are tracked and merged at the end.

## Product Specs vs Tech Specs

| Aspect | Product Spec (External) | Tech Spec (SPEC.md) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Focus | WHAT and WHY | HOW |
| Sections | Overview, User Stories, Requirements | + Technical Design, API Contracts, Data Model |
| Detail | Business-focused | Implementation-focused |
| Source | Imported | Generated |
| Location | `sdd/archive/external-specs/` | `changes/YYYY/MM/DD/.../` |

## Workflow Commands

```
# Import external spec
/sdd I want to import an external spec

# Check status
/sdd

# Continue with next item
/sdd I want to continue

# List all items
/sdd I want to list my changes

# Answer open questions
/sdd I want to answer an open question

# Approve spec (after all questions resolved)
/sdd I want to approve the spec

# Begin planning (after ALL specs approved)
/sdd I want to start planning
```

## Tips

**External specs are incomplete by nature.** Expect to answer many questions, especially about backend logic and API design.

**Q&A is never lost.** Every question and answer is preserved in the spec for future reference.

**One spec at a time.** For large decompositions, you work through each spec interactively before moving to planning.

**Phase gating is strict.** ALL specs must be approved before ANY planning starts.

**Backend is derived from frontend.** If the spec describes UI, SDD will derive the necessary API endpoints and data models.
